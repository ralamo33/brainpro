Next I want to be able to quickly set images to random objects/images/concepts lets invent a workflow that

1. Given a list of items to keywords will find those keywords
2. Scrape internet for those images
3. Show a preview of concept of word to image with ability to easily swap
4. Input those image to key in a database with something like "category", "concept", "image_url"
5. Do 2 way associations, image to concept. Then concept to encryption
